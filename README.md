# CompetitiveBot
A discord bot which aggregates contestant information like live ranklists, user ratings, solving history etc. from popular competitive programming platforms like
Codeforces, Topcoder etc. The bot also gives problem recommendations filtered on problem rating and topic tags.

## To Install:
